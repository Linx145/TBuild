TBuild is a library and mod that allows you to save individual
structures built in game as tbx files, which can then be loaded
programmatically in order to provide a smoother and less
brain-damaging way of creating modded structures.
It also provides a handful of useful commands, such as
/replacetile, /replacewall, /settile, and /q to quit out of the game
without saving.
